Quick Sign App - A Signature Capture Web Application
This project aims to create a simple web application where users can electronically capture their signatures using their mouse or touch screen. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

Signature Pad: The core component will be a designated area on the screen (likely a <canvas> element) where users can draw their signature using their mouse or finger.
Drawing Functionality: JavaScript will handle capturing user input on the canvas, translating it into lines drawn on the canvas element, essentially replicating the signature.
Clear and Undo Buttons : You can add buttons that allow users to clear the entire signature or undo the last drawn stroke for corrections.
Download Signature: Implement functionality to download the captured signature as an image file (e.g., PNG) for users to save or use elsewhere.
Technical Description:

Front-end: HTML will provide the basic structure of the web page, CSS will style the elements, and JavaScript will handle capturing user interaction and manipulating the canvas element to render the signature.
Libraries: While not essential, you can explore existing JavaScript libraries like "signature_pad" (https://github.com/topics/signature-pad) to simplify the signature capturing process.
Project Deliverables:

HTML file: The main web page structure.
CSS file (Optional): If you decide to style the app.
JavaScript file: Code responsible for capturing user input and rendering the signature.
Optional elements: Code for clear/undo buttons and signature download functionality.
Further Enhancements:

Signature Color Selection: Allow users to choose the color of their signature.
Touch Screen Optimization: Ensure the app functions smoothly on touch screen devices.
Security Considerations: Explore ways to securely store or transmit captured signatures if needed for your use case.
